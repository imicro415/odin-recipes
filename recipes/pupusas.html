      <p class="recipe-description">Pupusas are a traditional dish from El Salvador and are 
similar to a corn pancake with bean and cheese or meat filling. They 
are similar to a flatbread or pancake that is made with corn flour 
(masa) and can be filled with a variety of different savory fillings, 
like cheese, beans, beef, pork or veggies.</p>
    <h2 class="recipe-heading">Ingredients for filling</h2>
      <ul class="recipe-list ingredients">
        <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño, seeded and diced</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1(15oz) can of central american red beans, drained</li>
        <li>2oz low moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Curtido for serving</li>
      </ul>
    <h2 class="recipe-heading">Ingredients for masa</h3>
      <ul class="recipe-list ingredients">
        <li>1 cup masa harina</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>Neutral oil, for frying</li>
      </ul>
    <h3 class="recipe-heading">Steps</h4>
      <ol class="recipe-list steps">
        <li>Make the filling: In a medium skillet over medium heat, add 
the oil, jalapeño and a pinch of salt. Cook until jalapeño has slightly 
softened, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cumin and cook until 
fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in the beans and a pinch of salt. Mash with a fork 
or potato masher until most of the beans are mashed but mixture is 
still chunky. Taste and season with salt, if necessary. Transfer 
mixture to a bowl and refrigerate until cool, 10 to 15 minutes. Once 
cool, remove from the fridge and stir in mozzarella until combined. 
Divide the mixture into 4 portions</li>
        <li>Make the dough: In a medium bowl, combine the masa 
harina, salt and ¾ cup warm water. Mix with straight, stiff fingers 
to form a dough. Using both hands, roll into a ball and return to the 
bowl. The dough should not be overly sticky, but also shouldn’t be so 
dry it crumbles. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes at room 
temperature.</li>
        <li>Divide the masa into 4 portions and roll into balls. 
While working with one ball, keep the others covered so they don’t 
dry out. Using your thumb, create a divot in the middle of the ball. 
Continue pressing all around the divot to create a bowl shape large 
enough to hold 1 portion of the bean filling.</li>
       <li>Add the bean filling to the masa and pinch around the 
edges until it’s closed. Roll again to make a uniform ball and place 
it on a piece of parchment paper. Using the palm and fingers of one 
hand, press the ball into a ½-inch-thick cake that is about 4½ inches 
in diameter. (Masa is very malleable, so pinch to close any cracks. 
It’s OK if some filling pokes through the surface of the corn cake.) 
Repeat with remaining portions of dough. If at any point the masa is 
cracking too much, moisten your hands with warm water and knead masa 
to reintroduce some moisture into the dough.</li>
      <li>In a large (12-inch) skillet over medium heat, add enough 
oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Once the oil is hot, gently add 
the pupusa by putting it on your fingertips and placing it in the pan 
away from you like you are waving away a fly. Add a second pupusa to 
the pan and fry both until the sides touching the pan are crispy with 
splotches of darker spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the pupusas and cook 
until the second sides are also crispy, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer 
to a plate lined with paper towels and season with salt. If there is 
any residue in the pan, wipe it out with a paper towel and start with 
fresh oil to cook the remaining pupusas. Serve warm with curtido or 
salsa alongside, if desired.</li>
