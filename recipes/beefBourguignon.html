      <p>Considered by many to be the mother of all stews, Beef 
Bourguignon is a French dish made with beef, bacon lardons, carrots, 
onions and mushrooms slow cooked in a rich red wine sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3 pounds beef chuck or other boneless stewing beef, cut 
into 2-inch cubes and patted dry</li>
        <li>2¼ teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>5 ounces lardons, pancetta or bacon, diced (about 1¼ 
cups)</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, sliced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 750-milliliter bottle of red wine</li>
        <li>1 large bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 large sprig of thyme</li>
        <li>8 ounces pearl onions, peeled (about 12 to 15 onions)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon EVOO</li>
        <li>Pinch sugar</li>
        <li>Chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Season beef with 2 teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. 
Set aside for at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or chill in 
the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot with a 
tightfitting lid, cook lardons over medium-low heat until fat is 
rendered and lardons are browned and crisp, about 10 to 15 minutes. 
Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve 
fat in pot.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Raise heat under pot to 
medium-high and cook until fat is starting to smoke. Lay half the 
beef cubes in a single layer in the pot, leaving space between 
pieces. Cook until well browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes; 
transfer pieces to a plate as they brown. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat, if necessary, to prevent burning. Stir in 
onion, carrot and remaining ¼ teaspoon salt and cook until soft, 
about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Stir in garlic and tomato paste, and cook for 1 minute. 
Stir in flour, cook for 1 minute, then add wine, bay leaf and thyme, 
scraping up brown bits at bottom of pot. Add browned beef and half 
the cooked lardons back to pot, cover, and transfer to oven. Let cook 
until beef is very tender, about 1½ hours, turning meat halfway 
through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet set over high heat, combine 
pearl onions, mushrooms, ¼ cup water, the olive oil and a pinch each 
of salt, pepper and sugar. Bring to a simmer, then cover and reduce 
heat to medium, cooking for 15 minutes. Uncover, raise heat to high, 
and cook, tossing frequently, until vegetables are well browned, 5 to 
7 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, scatter onions and mushrooms and remaining 
cooked lardons over stew, then top with parsley.</li>
      </ol>
